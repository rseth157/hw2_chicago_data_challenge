Data Challenge project

For this assignment
 
I have used <br>
Public Health Services- Chicago Primary Care Community Health Centers<br> (https://data.cityofchicago.org/Health-Human-Services/Public-Health-Services-Chicago-Primary-Care-Commun/cjg8-dbka) and 
 
Public Health Statistics- Life Expectancy By Community Area<br> (https://data.cityofchicago.org/Health-Human-Services/Public-Health-Statistics-Life-Expectancy-By-Commun/qjr3-bm53) data sets
 
to analyze<br>
1. If the clinics are equally distributed in various communities<br>
2. if there is any relationship between the number of health clinics and life expectancy in the area.

I have used java for this assignment.
