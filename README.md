Data Challenge project

For this assignment
 
I have used 
Public Health Services- Chicago Primary Care Community Health Centers (https://data.cityofchicago.org/Health-Human-Services/Public-Health-Services-Chicago-Primary-Care-Commun/cjg8-dbka) and 
 
Public Health Statistics- Life Expectancy By Community Area (https://data.cityofchicago.org/Health-Human-Services/Public-Health-Statistics-Life-Expectancy-By-Commun/qjr3-bm53) data sets
 
to analyze
1. If the clinics are equally distributed in various communities
2. if there is any relationship between the number of health clinics and life expectancy in the area.
